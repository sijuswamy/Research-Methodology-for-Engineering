Understanding these categories helps researchers select an appropriate methodology. A mind map of approved types of research is given below.\n\n\nBasic (Fundamental) Research: Aims to expand general knowledge without immediate practical application. Often theoretical, basic research seeks to increase understanding of fundamental principles.\nExample: A theoretical physics study on string theory aims to enhance understanding of the universe’s structure without immediate practical application.\nApplied Research: Seeks to solve practical, real-world problems by applying existing knowledge.\nCase Study: A research project aiming to optimize renewable energy sources (e.g., solar or wind) for urban settings, providing solutions to real-world energy challenges.\nDescriptive Research: Focuses on describing phenomena as they exist without manipulating variables. Common in fields like psychology, sociology, and market research.\nExample: A study analyzing consumer preferences in online shopping behavior, collecting data on demographics, shopping frequency, and preferences without altering the environment.\nAnalytical Research: Uses existing data to explore new relationships and insights, typically involving statistical analysis.\nCase Study: An analysis of existing health data to identify patterns in the spread of a disease, like examining historical data from past flu outbreaks to predict future trends.\nExploratory Research: Conducted to gain insight into an area with limited existing knowledge. Often serves as a preliminary step to more structured research.\nExample: Interviews with social media influencers to explore how they perceive their role in modern advertising could serve as the basis for more in-depth studies on social influence.\nConfirmatory Research: Conducted to confirm hypotheses or theories by testing specific predictions, often using statistical tests to validate results.\nCase Study: A psychology study tests whether a new therapeutic approach reduces anxiety levels in a specific demographic, using structured methods to confirm initial hypotheses.\nQuantitative Research: Involves the collection and analysis of numerical data to find patterns, test hypotheses, or make predictions. It often uses structured tools like surveys or experiments.\nQualitative Research: Focuses on exploring ideas, understanding experiences, and interpreting non-numerical data, typically collected through interviews, observations, and open-ended surveys.",

The purpose is to develop a body of literature that establishes a contrarian viewpoint. Given the value-laden nature of some social science research [e.g., educational reform; immigration control], argumentative approaches to analyzing the literature can be a legitimate and important form of discourse. However, note that they can also introduce problems of bias when they are used to make summary claims of the sort found in systematic reviews.\nIntegrative Review: Considered a form of research that reviews, critiques, and synthesizes representative literature on a topic in an integrated way such that new frameworks and perspectives on the topic are generated. The body of literature includes all studies that address related or identical hypotheses. A well-done integrative review meets the same standards as primary research in regard to clarity, rigor, and replication.\nHistorical Review: Few things rest in isolation from historical precedent. Historical reviews are focused on examining research throughout a period of time, often starting with the first time an issue, concept, theory, phenomenon emerged in the literature, then tracing its evolution within the scholarship of a discipline. The purpose is to place research in a historical context to show familiarity with state-of-the-art developments and to identify the likely directions for future research.\nMethodological Review: A review does not always focus on what someone said [content], but how they said it [method of analysis]. This approach provides a framework of understanding at different levels (i.e. those of theory, substantive fields, research approaches, and data collection and analysis techniques), enables researchers to draw on a wide variety of knowledge ranging from the conceptual level to practical documents for use in fieldwork in the areas of ontological and epistemological consideration, quantitative and qualitative integration, sampling, interviewing, data collection and data analysis, and helps highlight many ethical issues which we should be aware of and consider as we go through our study.\nSystematic Review: This form consists of an overview of existing evidence pertinent to a clearly formulated research question, which uses pre-specified and standardized methods to identify and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect, report, and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. Typically it focuses on a very specific empirical question, often posed in a cause-and-effect form, such as “To what extent does A contribute to B?”\nTheoretical Review: The purpose of this form is to concretely examine the corpus of theory that has accumulated in regard to an issue, concept, theory, phenomenon. The theoretical literature review help establish what theories already exist, the relationships between them, to what degree the existing theories have been investigated, and to develop new hypotheses to be tested. Often this form is used to help establish a lack of appropriate theories or reveal that current theories are inadequate for explaining new or emerging research problems. The unit of analysis can focus on a theoretical concept or a whole theory or framework.",

    "section": "2.6 Identifying Key Concepts and Keywords for Literature Review",
    "text": "2.6 Identifying Key Concepts and Keywords for Literature Review\nOne of the first tasks when conducting a literature review is to clearly identify the research topic or question. This step involves a comprehensive understanding of the topic, breaking it down into smaller components, and identifying key concepts that will form the foundation of the literature search.\nTo begin with, the researcher needs to understand the broader research field and the specific problem they intend to solve. For example, a study focused on improving solar panel efficiency using advanced materials requires an understanding of both solar technology and material science. These broad topics provide the groundwork for narrowing down the scope and identifying the key concepts such as solar efficiency, material properties, and energy conversion. A well-defined topic enables the researcher to break down the research question into its component parts, identifying the main ideas that will guide the literature search.\nOnce the research question has been clarified, it should be broken down into its fundamental components. Typically, these components are the essential nouns or noun phrases that represent the focus of the research. This step ensures that every relevant aspect of the question is examined. For instance, in a study asking, “What is the effect of renewable energy integration on grid stability?”, the main components would be renewable energy (the broad area), power grid (the context), and grid stability (the outcome). By dissecting the research question, the researcher can form a more targeted approach to their literature search, ensuring that no critical areas are overlooked.\nThe next step involves identifying the key concepts, which are the cornerstone ideas directly related to the research problem. These key concepts are central to the research and should reflect the primary focus areas. For example, in a study on predictive maintenance using machine learning in industrial robots, the key concepts might be predictive maintenance, machine learning, and industrial robots. These concepts guide the researcher in identifying the most relevant literature, theories, and models that apply to their area of study.\nSynonyms and alternative phrases for each key concept must also be considered to capture a broader range of literature. Different researchers may use varied terminology for similar concepts, so it’s essential to consider all possible variations. Taking renewable energy as an example, synonyms such as green energy, clean energy, sustainable energy, and alternative energy sources should be used to ensure a comprehensive search. Similarly, the term machine learning might also be represented by terms like artificial intelligence, predictive algorithms, or neural networks. Using a variety of synonyms and alternative phrases in the literature search increases the likelihood of retrieving relevant studies that might otherwise be missed.\nBoolean operators play a crucial role in refining the literature search. These operators — AND, OR, and NOT — are used to combine or exclude specific keywords in a search, helping to narrow down or broaden the results. For instance, using AND in the query “renewable energy AND grid stability” will retrieve studies that discuss both renewable energy and grid stability together, while using OR in “renewable energy OR alternative energy sources” will provide results for either term. Excluding unrelated topics can also be done using NOT, as in “renewable energy NOT fossil fuels,” which will eliminate studies focused on fossil fuels. Effectively utilizing Boolean operators allows researchers to fine-tune their search and yield more focused and relevant results.\nIn addition to Boolean operators, truncation and wildcards are powerful tools in literature searching. Truncation involves using a symbol, usually an asterisk (), to search for multiple word forms. For example, searching for “optim” will return results for optimize, optimization, and optimizing. Wildcards, on the other hand, allow the researcher to search for words with various spellings, such as “colo*r” to capture both color and colour. This technique ensures that different word forms and spellings do not lead to missed relevant studies.\nBuilding a keyword list is another essential step in organizing a literature search. After identifying key concepts and their synonyms, the researcher should create a list of keywords. This list must cover the primary terms and their variations to ensure that the search is thorough and inclusive. For instance, for a study on data privacy in cloud computing systems, the keyword list might include terms like data privacy, cloud security, encryption, cloud storage, confidential computing, and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Having a well-structured keyword list allows the researcher to run an organized and efficient literature search across databases.\nIt’s also crucial to search in specialized databases relevant to the field of study. Different disciplines have dedicated databases that house specialized research. For example, engineering research may require the use of IEEE Xplore, while medical research might rely on PubMed or Medline. These databases focus on high-quality, field-specific studies and can provide more accurate and reliable information for the literature review. For example, a mechanical engineering researcher might use IEEE Xplore to search for studies related to robotics or automation, while a medical researcher investigating clinical trials may turn to PubMed or the Cochrane Library. Choosing the appropriate database is key to finding relevant and valuable studies.\nAfter conducting the initial search, the results need to be carefully reviewed to determine their relevance to the research question. Titles, abstracts, and keywords should be examined to assess whether the articles align with the research objectives. If the results are not as relevant as expected, the researcher may need to refine their search strategy by adjusting keywords, adding Boolean operators, or excluding certain topics. For instance, if a search for machine learning AND predictive maintenance returns too many general results on machine learning, refining the search with a more specific term, such as in industrial robots, can help narrow the focus. This process of reviewing and refining the search ensures that the literature review is focused and that the most relevant studies are included.",

It involves defining the research objective, understanding system behavior, and identifying variables and constraints. Well-formulated problems lead to efficient experiment designs and meaningful conclusions.\nSteps in Problem Formulation:\n\nObjective Definition: Clearly state the purpose of the experiment or study.\nVariable Identification: Determine the dependent (response) and independent (input) variables.\nConstraints: List the practical and theoretical limitations (e.g., resources, physical conditions).\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Objective Definition\nTo begin with, the researcher needs to clearly define the objective of their study. A well-defined objective guides the entire research process and ensures that the study addresses specific questions effectively. For instance, consider a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a new medication. The objective could be to determine whether this new medication significantly improves patient outcomes compared to a placebo. By setting a clear objective, researchers establish a focus that will help in setting precise goals, formulating hypotheses, and designing the experiment.\n\n\n\nMindmap on problem formulation.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Variable Identification\nIdentifying variables is crucial for designing an effective experiment. Variables are classified into independent, dependent, and control categories. The independent variables are those that are manipulated by the researcher, while dependent variables are the outcomes measured in response to these manipulations. Control variables are kept constant to ensure that they do not affect the results.\nFor example, in a clinical trial investigating a new drug, the independent variable could be the dosage of the drug administered, the dependent variable could be the reduction in symptoms, and control variables might include factors like the age and gender of participants. By carefully identifying and controlling these variables, researchers can isolate the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables.\n\n\n\nVariable Identification Steps\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Constraints\nConstraints are limitations that affect the research design and implementation. These could be related to budget, time, or resources. Identifying constraints helps researchers plan a feasible study and manage expectations realistically.\nFor instance, if a research project is constrained by a limited budget, it may be necessary to reduce the number of participants or simplify the experimental design. Similarly, time constraints might affect the duration of the study or the complexity of the data collection process. Understanding these constraints is essential for developing a practical research plan that can achieve meaningful results within the available resources.\n\n\n\nConstrains in Research\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Modelling & Simulation\n\n3.1.5.1 Mathematical Models\nMathematical models use mathematical equations to represent relationships between variables and predict outcomes. These models help in understanding complex systems and making quantitative predictions.\nFor example, a linear regression model might be used to study the effect of different drug dosages on blood pressure. In this case, the model would use an equation to describe the relationship between dosage (independent variable) and blood pressure (dependent variable). The results can provide insights into how varying dosages might affect blood pressure, helping researchers optimize treatment protocols.\n\n\n\nMathematical and Statistical Models\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.2 Simulation Models\nSimulation models replicate real-world processes to predict outcomes under various scenarios. They allow researchers to test different conditions and understand how variables interact in a controlled environment.\nFor example, a Monte Carlo simulation might be used to assess the risk of different investment strategies. By running simulations with random variables representing market conditions, researchers can estimate the potential risks and returns of various investment options, helping investors make informed decisions based on simulated outcomes.\n\n\n\nSimulation Models",

It serves as the default assumption that researchers aim to test against.\nFor instance, in a clinical trial comparing two drugs, the null hypothesis might state, “There is no difference in blood pressure reduction between Drug A and Drug B.” Researchers then use statistical tests to determine if the observed data provides sufficient evidence to reject this null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\nThe alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposes that there is an effect or difference between groups. It reflects the researcher’s prediction or expectation.\nFor example, if researchers believe that Drug A will significantly reduce blood pressure more than Drug B, the alternative hypothesis might be, “Patients receiving Drug A will experience a greater reduction in blood pressure compared to those receiving Drug B.” This hypothesis is tested against the null hypothesis to evaluate the evidence for the predicted effect.",

By examining all possible combinations of these factors, researchers can determine their individual and interactive effects on the reaction yield.\n\n\n\nMindmap on Statistical Design.\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2 Fractional Factorial Design\nFractional factorial design involves testing only a subset of all possible combinations of factors. It is resource-efficient and suitable when dealing with a large number of variables, providing valuable information while reducing the number of experiments required.\nFor example, if studying the effects of five different factors on product quality, a fractional factorial design might select a subset of factor combinations to analyze, thereby saving time and resources while still yielding significant insights.\n\n\n3.8.3 Field Experiments\nField experiments are conducted in natural settings rather than controlled environments. They provide insights into how variables interact in real-world conditions, offering practical evidence of effectiveness.\nFor instance, a field experiment might test the impact of a new teaching method in a classroom setting. Researchers can observe how the method performs under everyday classroom conditions, providing valuable information about its real-world effectiveness.\n\n\n\nMindmap on field experiments.",

By asking participants about their views and experiences, researchers can obtain a broad understanding of public sentiment and its implications for policy implementation.\n\n\n\nData collection stage.\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Sampling\nSampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to make inferences about the entire group. Techniques include random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic sampling.\nFor instance, random sampling might be used in a study to estimate election results. By surveying a randomly selected group of voters, researchers can infer the preferences of the entire voter population and predict the likely outcome of the election.\n\n\n3.9.3 Observation\nObservation involves systematically recording behaviors or phenomena as they occur. It can be structured or unstructured, depending on the research objectives.\nFor example, an observer might record consumer behavior in a store to understand shopping patterns. By noting the frequency and types of purchases, researchers can gain insights into consumer preferences and purchasing habits.",

    "text": "6.1.1 1. What is plagiarism? Explain the role of literature review in preventing and detecting plagiarism.\nPlagiarism is the unauthorized use of another’s work or ideas without proper attribution, violating academic integrity.\nRole of Literature Review: - Familiarizes researchers with existing research, aiding accurate attribution.\n\nEnhances citation practices, helping to avoid unintentional plagiarism.\nImproves skills in paraphrasing and summarization.\nHighlights research gaps, encouraging original contributions.\nEncourages the use of plagiarism-detection tools, promoting ethical research.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 2. Explain the criteria for selecting a viable research problem. Discuss challenges researchers may face during formulation and strategies to overcome them.\n\nCriteria for Selecting a Viable Research Problem\n\n\nRelevance: Addresses a real need or gap, contributing to current knowledge.\nOriginality: Provides a fresh perspective or innovative approach.\nFeasibility: Realistic within time, resources, and expertise available.\nSpecificity and Focus: Clearly defined and narrow in scope.\nEthical Acceptability: Aligns with ethical guidelines.\nSignificance: Holds theoretical or practical value with broader impact.\n\n\nChallenges:\n\n\nAmbiguity in problem definition: Address by starting broad, then refining.\nLimited resources: Plan research within available budget and time.\nLiterature overload: Focus on recent, high-quality sources.\n\nStrategies: - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable questions. - Seek feedback from mentors or peers. - Use systematic review techniques to manage and organize literature.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 3. How is authorship credited if two people work on a similar topic and publish jointly, but most of the work is done by one person?\n\nAuthorship should reflect contributions. The person who contributed more may be listed as the first author.\nAcknowledgments can note specific contributions, ensuring transparency and fairness.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 4. What is the format for in-text citation and bibliographic item in APA style?\n\nIn-Text Citation: (Author’s Last Name, Year)\nExample: (Smith, 2023).\nReference List Entry: Author’s Last Name, First Initial. (Year). Title of the work. Publisher.\nExample: Smith, J. (2023). Research Basics. Academic Press.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 5. What is DOI?\nA DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to publications to enable reliable digital access. It identifies and links electronic articles.\n\n\n\n6.1.6 6. Difference between patented products and research output?\n\nPatented Product: Legally protected innovation with potential commercial application.\nResearch Output: Scholarly work adding to knowledge, typically without legal protection unless patented.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7 7. What is the role of editors in a journal?\nEditors manage the review process, ensure quality control, maintain ethical standards, guide revisions, and make publication decisions, all of which uphold the journal’s credibility.\n\n\n\n6.1.8 8. What is the impact factor of a journal, and how do I find it?\n\nImpact Factor: Measures a journal’s average citation count per article, indicating its influence.\nFinding Impact Factor: Check journal websites, use Web of Science, or visit the publisher’s page.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.9 9. What is the H5-index and H5-median on Google Scholar?\n\nH5-index: Reflects the number of articles with at least five citations in the past five years.\nH5-median: Shows the median citation count of articles in the H5-index, giving insight into citation distribution.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.10 10. What is an author’s H-index?\nAn H-index quantifies an author’s productivity and citation impact, where an author has h articles each cited at least h times, indicating sustained research influence.\n\n\n\n6.1.11 11. Differentiate between a Broad Research Topic and a Well-Defined Research Problem. Explain the steps to narrow down to a research problem with an example.\nBroad Research Topic: - A general area of interest that sets the research direction but lacks specific objectives. - Example: “Impacts of social media on mental health” covers various aspects like platforms, demographics, and mental health outcomes.\nWell-Defined Research Problem: - A focused, specific issue that the research aims to address, providing clear boundaries. - Example: “How does daily Instagram usage affect anxiety levels among college students?” This question specifies the platform (Instagram), target group (college students), and mental health aspect (anxiety).\n\nSteps to Narrow Down a Broad Topic to a Research Problem\n\n\nIdentify a Broad Interest Area:\n\nChoose an area aligned with academic, professional, or societal needs.\nExample: “Social media and mental health.”\n\nConduct Preliminary Literature Review:\n\nExamine current research trends and gaps to identify specific areas within the topic.\nExample Finding: Limited studies on how specific platforms influence specific mental health issues.\n\nRefine the Focus:\n\nNarrow to a subgroup, context, or specific variable to create a targeted scope.\nExample: Focusing on Instagram usage’s impact on anxiety in a specific demographic.\n\nFormulate the Research Problem:\n\nDraft a research question that highlights the core issue and the population involved.\nFinal Example: “What is the relationship between daily Instagram usage and anxiety levels among college students?”\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.12 12. Discuss the ethical issues involved in the scenario where a former student’s data is used without permission.\nSolution:\n\nOwnership of Data:\nThe primary ethical issue is data ownership. The former student has rights over their data, and using it without permission violates ethical standards. Failing to obtain consent infringes upon the former student’s intellectual and proprietary rights over their own research contributions.\nInformed Consent:\nEthical research mandates informed consent from all contributors. The co-authors should have explicitly sought permission from the former student before utilizing their data. Obtaining consent ensures transparency and maintains trust among collaborators.\nIntegrity of Research:\nUsing data without proper authorization can compromise the research’s integrity, raising doubts about the credibility and validity of the findings. Ethical lapses in data use can lead to the research being scrutinized or dismissed by peers.\nConsequences of Misconduct:\nIf the former student denies permission to use the data, the authors face an ethical decision. They must either honor the student’s decision and seek alternative data sources or risk repercussions, which may include damage to their professional reputations and potential academic consequences.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.13 13. Throughout this course you have been repeatedly asked about the importance of interpreting the findings of your research study. Explain why this is an essential element of high-quality research work.\nSolution:\nInterpreting research findings is a critical element in high-quality research because it:\n\nEnsures Contextual Understanding: Proper interpretation allows researchers to place their findings within the broader context of existing literature and theories, linking their work to prior research and advancing the field.\nDraws Meaningful Conclusions: Interpretation transforms raw data into actionable insights. It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships that lead to meaningful conclusions and recommendations.\nValidates the Hypothesis: It helps determine whether the findings support or contradict the original hypothesis, providing a clear understanding of the research question.\nEnhances Credibility: Transparent and rigorous interpretation demonstrates the researcher’s competence, ensuring the research is credible and trustworthy.\nGuides Future Research: A clear interpretation of findings highlights gaps, limitations, and potential directions for future research, contributing to the scientific discourse.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.14 14. In a literature survey, a researcher includes a paragraph from another work as running text without using in-text citation but instead puts (see the work of …) in brackets. Is this plagiarism? If so, what is the right way to correct this misconduct?\nSolution:\nYes, this is considered plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when another researcher’s work, ideas, or words are used without proper attribution, regardless of whether the author intends to claim the work as their own. Simply placing a reference in brackets like “(see the work of …)” does not satisfy the ethical requirement of citation. This is not a valid method of citing someone else’s work, and it misrepresents the origin of the ideas or text.\n\nCorrective Steps:\n\nTo correct this misconduct, the researcher should:\n\nProperly Attribute the Source: The correct way to cite the paragraph would be to explicitly include the appropriate in-text citation, such as (Author, Year), where “Author” is the last name of the original author and “Year” is the year of publication.\nUse Direct Quotation for Exact Text: If the text is directly quoted, it must be placed in quotation marks and followed by the proper citation. For example:\n&gt; “Exact text from the original work” (Author, Year).\nParaphrase and Cite: If the researcher paraphrases the idea or findings from the original work, they must still provide an in-text citation, e.g., (Author, Year), to acknowledge the source of the ideas.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.15 15. If a literature survey misconduct, such as failing to properly cite a source, is considered a serious issue under the university’s code of conduct and leads to the cancellation of registration, should this misconduct be forgivable, or as a dean, should the person be required to reapply for the program?\nSolution:\nAs a dean, the decision about whether the misconduct is forgivable or whether the student should reapply for the program should be carefully considered, taking into account the severity of the misconduct and the broader context.\n\nFactors to Consider:\n\n\nIntent and Acknowledgement:\n\nUnintentional Mistake: If the student can demonstrate that the failure to cite correctly was an honest mistake or misunderstanding of citation practices, and they acknowledge this, it could be treated as a learning opportunity. In such cases, a corrective action, such as re-taking academic integrity training or re-submitting the work with proper citations, could be considered.\nDeliberate Misconduct: If the student knowingly plagiarized or attempted to deceive, this is a more serious violation. Academic integrity violations of this nature can compromise the reputation of the university and the student’s academic standing.\n\nPattern of Behavior:\n\nIf this is a first-time offense and there is no history of similar misconduct, there might be grounds for allowing the student to reapply, provided they demonstrate genuine remorse and a willingness to learn from the incident.\nA repeated offense or a pattern of academic dishonesty would suggest that the student has not taken the university’s code of conduct seriously, and in such cases, stricter actions, including requiring them to reapply, may be necessary.\n\nUniversity Code of Conduct:\n\nThe university’s code of conduct should clearly outline the consequences of academic misconduct. If the code specifies that a violation of this nature leads to registration cancellation, then it is important to follow the rules, while still considering the possibility of remedial actions to help the student.\n\nEducational Opportunity:\n\nIf the student is willing to accept responsibility, undergo corrective measures, and demonstrate a commitment to academic integrity moving forward, the option to reapply for the program may be a reasonable one, allowing the student to learn from the mistake and return with a better understanding of the university’s expectations.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: If the misconduct is considered serious but not entirely malicious, forgiveness with conditions could be an option. This could include allowing the student to reapply after a specified time period, provided they complete educational modules on academic integrity, and submit a reformed research proposal with proper citation. However, if the misconduct reflects a more profound disregard for academic norms, then reapplication may be necessary to ensure that the student fully understands the gravity of the issue and the university’s commitment to academic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.16 16. Two PhD students working under the same supervisor have similar work. One drafts a paper and asks the other to revise it. The supervisor approves, and the paper gets accepted at a conference. It appears in both students’ PhD theses. Is this responsible conduct? What action would you take as the Dean? Is the supervisor irresponsible?\nSolution:\n\nEthical Issues:\n\n\nAuthorship Misrepresentation: The second student did most of the work, but both students were listed as co-authors. According to the APS Code of Conduct, authorship should reflect substantial intellectual contribution. The first student should not be a co-author unless they significantly contributed to the paper beyond the initial draft.\nSupervisor’s Responsibility: The supervisor’s role is to ensure proper credit is given to all contributors. In this case, the supervisor failed to ensure proper authorship distribution, potentially misrepresenting the contributions and undermining academic integrity.\nAcademic Integrity: Using the same paper for both students’ theses raises concerns of redundant publication. This can be seen as misleading since both students are claiming the same work as part of their independent research.\n\n\nActions as Dean:\n\n\nInvestigate the contributions of both students and the supervisor’s involvement in the authorship decision.\nCorrect authorship: The second student should be credited as the primary author, with the first student acknowledged in the acknowledgment section, if applicable.\nCounsel the supervisor about their responsibility in ensuring fair authorship and proper attribution.\nReview the theses to ensure that no redundant publication is claimed, and take necessary corrective action if required.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.17 17. Two PhD students working under the same supervisor have similar work. One drafts a paper based on an exercise from an external source with some original contribution. Due to time constraints, he/she ask the other to revise it. The supervisor approves, and the paper is accepted at a conference with joint authorship. It appears in both students’ PhD theses. Is this responsible conduct? What action would you take as the Dean? Is the supervisor irresponsible?\nSolution:\n\nEthical Issues:\n\n\nAuthorship and Contribution:\n\nThe student who did the draft should be credited for their original contributions, but the second student, who did the majority of the revisions, should not be an equal co-author unless they made substantial intellectual contributions.\nAccording to ethical research practices, authorship should reflect the level of contribution made to the work. If the second student did the majority of the work, their authorship status should be more prominent. Simply revising the work does not usually justify equal authorship.\n\nUse of External Source:\n\nThe use of an exercise from an external source should be properly acknowledged in the paper to avoid any plagiarism or misrepresentation of ideas. If the work is borrowed, citing the original source is necessary.\n\nThesis and Redundant Publication:\n\nIf the same paper is included in both PhD theses, this could lead to self-plagiarism if the students claim the same work as original contributions in their theses. The students must differentiate their contributions in their theses or use the paper as a basis for further, independent research.\n\n\n\nActions as Dean:\n\n\nInvestigate the Contributions:\n\nReview the contributions of each student in the paper and confirm if the authorship is correctly assigned. If one student did most of the work, they should be the primary author, and the other should be appropriately acknowledged.\n\nEnsure Proper Citations:\n\nEnsure that the external source of the exercise is properly cited in the paper to avoid plagiarism.\n\nAddress Redundant Publication:\n\nIf the paper appears in both students’ theses, ensure that this is not treated as original research for both. Advise the students to differentiate their research work in the theses, ensuring there is no overlap or redundancy.\n\nCounsel the Supervisor:\n\nThe supervisor should take a more active role in overseeing authorship and ensuring proper research practices. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that credit is assigned accurately and ethically. They should have reviewed the paper thoroughly and ensured that authorship was determined based on substantial contribution.\n\n\n\nNot responsible conduct: The authorship issue needs correction, and the students must ensure their individual contributions are properly acknowledged in their theses. The supervisor is also partially responsible for this situation as they did not adequately review and address authorship and contributions.\nActions: Correct the authorship and clarify the contributions of each student in both the paper and the theses. The supervisor should also be reminded of their ethical responsibility in overseeing proper research conduct and authorship assignment.\n\n\n\n6.1.18 18. What is the difference between reference and a bibliography in research publications?\nSolution:\n\nReference: A list of sources that are directly cited in the research paper. Each reference corresponds to a specific in-text citation used to support claims or provide context within the work.\nBibliography: A comprehensive list of all sources consulted during the research process, regardless of whether they were cited in the paper. It may include references, but also sources that were read for background information or inspiration.",

    "text": "6.2 Case studies:\n\n6.2.1 Scenario 1:\nA researcher works in a laboratory and records data and results in a research diary. After a few years, the researcher changes institutions, joins a new lab, and applies for a patent for work that was completed in the previous lab.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\n\nWhat ethical concerns arise when a researcher applies for a patent based on work completed at a previous institution?\nAnswer: The primary ethical concern in this scenario is the ownership of intellectual property. The researcher should have acknowledged the previous institution’s contribution, as the work was completed there. Applying for a patent without informing the previous lab or obtaining permission can be considered a breach of ethical standards and can undermine the integrity of the research process. According to the American Physical Society (APS) Code of Conduct, researchers should ensure proper attribution and respect for the work of previous collaborators.\nIs the researcher’s action of applying for a patent without acknowledging the previous institution or lab a violation of research ethics?\nAnswer: Yes, this action violates research ethics. According to the APS Code of Conduct, researchers must properly acknowledge all contributors and institutions involved in the research. The failure to disclose the prior institution and its involvement in the research can lead to accusations of misappropriation of intellectual property and lack of transparency.\nHow does the lack of prior approval or acknowledgment of the former lab impact the integrity of the research process?\nAnswer: The lack of prior approval or acknowledgment of the former lab compromises the integrity of the research process by neglecting to provide fair credit to all parties involved in the research. It also creates a potential conflict over intellectual property rights, which can lead to disputes. The APS Code emphasizes the importance of collaboration and transparency, which are essential to maintaining trust in the research community.\nDoes this scenario constitute academic misconduct? If so, which ethical principles are violated?\nAnswer: Yes, this scenario could constitute academic misconduct. The primary ethical principles violated include intellectual property rights, misrepresentation, and lack of transparency. The researcher failed to consult with the previous institution and did not acknowledge the contributions of the original lab, which could be seen as misappropriating the work for personal gain without giving proper credit.\nIs the researcher’s failure to inform the previous lab and obtain consent for the patent application considered research misconduct? Why or why not?\nAnswer: Yes, the researcher’s failure to inform the previous lab and obtain consent for the patent application is considered a form of research misconduct. According to the APS Code of Conduct, researchers must act with integrity and ensure that all contributors are properly acknowledged. By omitting the previous institution from the patent application, the researcher violated the ethical standards related to honesty, attribution, and the responsible conduct of research.\nHow does intellectual property law intersect with research ethics in this case?\nAnswer: Intellectual property law plays a critical role in determining who holds the rights to the research and its outputs, such as patents. From an ethical standpoint, the APS Code of Conduct aligns with intellectual property law by promoting the fair and transparent attribution of work. The researcher should have followed both ethical guidelines and legal protocols by obtaining consent from the previous institution before filing for a patent. This ensures respect for intellectual property and prevents disputes over ownership.\nAs an academic institution, how would you address the ethical violation in this case? What actions should be taken to ensure proper acknowledgment and handling of intellectual property?\nAnswer: As an academic institution, the first step would be to investigate the case to understand the facts. If the researcher did not follow proper procedures for acknowledging the previous institution, the institution should work with the researcher to address the issue. Actions could include issuing a formal warning, requiring the researcher to properly acknowledge the previous institution in any subsequent publications or patent applications, and ensuring that any legal disputes are resolved. Additionally, institutions should provide clear guidelines on intellectual property management and the importance of acknowledging all contributors.\nWhat steps should the researcher take to rectify the situation if the patent application has already been filed?\nAnswer: If the patent application has already been filed, the researcher should immediately inform the previous institution and any co-authors involved in the original work. They should seek approval from the previous lab and update the patent application to include the proper acknowledgment. The researcher should also ensure that the previous institution’s rights are respected and that all contributions are accurately documented. If necessary, the researcher should work with legal advisors to resolve any conflicts over intellectual property rights.\nWhat strategies can be implemented in research institutions to prevent similar ethical issues from arising in the future?\nAnswer: Research institutions can implement several strategies to prevent similar ethical issues, such as:\n\nProviding clear guidelines on intellectual property rights and patent applications.\nEnsuring that all researchers understand the importance of acknowledging contributions from previous institutions or labs.\nPromoting transparency and open communication regarding the ownership of research data and outcomes.\nOffering training on responsible research practices, particularly in relation to patenting and publication.\n\nHow should institutions handle intellectual property agreements with researchers to ensure transparency and accountability?\n\nAnswer: Institutions should establish clear intellectual property agreements that outline the ownership and rights to research outputs. These agreements should be discussed at the outset of a research project and updated as necessary, particularly when researchers move between labs or institutions. By setting clear expectations and ensuring that all parties are aware of their rights and responsibilities, institutions can foster a culture of transparency and accountability. Furthermore, institutions should have mechanisms in place to resolve disputes and provide guidance on ethical issues related to intellectual property.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 1. Scenario: Unauthorized Use of Laboratory Equipment\nA researcher in a university laboratory uses the equipment after hours without informing the lab supervisor or other researchers. The researcher completes a significant part of their experiment using the equipment, but the work is not properly documented.\n\nEthical Issue: Unauthorized use of institutional resources, lack of transparency, and neglecting to inform others involved in the research.\n\n\nSolution: According to the American Physical Society Code of Ethics, researchers must act with integrity and respect institutional policies. The researcher should have sought approval from the supervisor and ensured proper documentation of all work. The researcher should be reminded of the importance of transparency and the ethical obligation to respect institutional resources.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 2. Scenario: Duplicate Publication of Research Results\nA researcher submits the same research findings to two different journals without informing the editors or authors of the other publication.\n\nEthical Issue: Duplicate publication and failure to disclose prior submissions.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics prohibits duplicate publication. The researcher should withdraw one submission, disclose the prior submission to both journals, and ensure that future submissions adhere to ethical guidelines. Both journals should be notified, and the researcher should be educated about the ethical obligation to disclose prior submissions to avoid misleading the academic community.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 3. Scenario: Co-authorship Dispute\nTwo researchers work on a project and contribute equally to the research. However, when the paper is submitted, one researcher’s name is omitted from the authorship list, despite their significant contributions.\n\nEthical Issue: Inappropriate authorship attribution and failure to acknowledge all contributors.\n\n\nSolution: As per the APS Code of Ethics, proper authorship must reflect the contributions of all involved. The omitted researcher should be added to the authorship list with appropriate acknowledgment. The supervisor should review the situation and ensure that authorship guidelines are clear and followed in the future. Institutions should establish protocols to resolve authorship disputes.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 4. Scenario: Fabrication of Data in a Research Experiment\nA researcher fabricates data in an experiment to make their results appear more significant. The data is later used in multiple publications.\n\nEthical Issue: Fabrication of data and misleading the scientific community.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics clearly condemns data fabrication. The researcher’s actions must be reported to the institution, and a thorough investigation should be conducted. The researcher should retract all affected publications, and any false claims should be corrected. Institutions should have strong procedures to prevent and address data falsification.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 5. Scenario: Plagiarism in Thesis Work\nA PhD student uses paragraphs directly from previously published articles without proper citation, integrating them into their thesis as part of their literature review.\n\nEthical Issue: Plagiarism and failure to properly attribute intellectual property.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics emphasizes the importance of proper citation to give credit to original authors. The student should be required to revise their thesis to properly cite all sources. The institution should implement a plagiarism detection process, and the student should undergo additional training on academic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 6. Scenario: Misuse of Research Funding\nA researcher uses a portion of their allocated research grant for personal expenses, violating the terms of the funding agreement.\n\nEthical Issue: Misuse of research funds and financial misconduct.\n\n\nSolution: According to the APS Code of Ethics, researchers must manage research funds responsibly. The researcher should be held accountable, and any misuse should be investigated thoroughly. The institution should implement stronger oversight of funding usage, and the researcher may be required to repay the misused funds.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.8 7. Scenario: Misleading Author Contributions\nA paper is published in which the order of authors is not reflective of their actual contributions. One author who contributed significantly is listed last, while another who did minimal work is placed first.\n\nEthical Issue: Misleading authorship order and failure to properly acknowledge contributions.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics requires proper attribution and transparency in authorship. The authorship order should be corrected, and all contributions should be clearly stated. Future publications should establish clear communication among authors regarding contributions and order of authorship.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.9 8. Scenario: Data Sharing Conflict\nA researcher collects unique data for their project but refuses to share it with other researchers, hindering collaboration and scientific progress.\n\nEthical Issue: Failure to share data and promote collaborative research.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics promotes openness and sharing of data to advance scientific knowledge. The researcher should be encouraged to share the data with others and collaborate in a way that benefits the scientific community. Institutions should foster an environment of transparency and collaboration by creating clear data-sharing policies.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.10 9. Scenario: Lack of Informed Consent for Experiment Participation\nA researcher conducts experiments involving human participants but does not obtain informed consent from all participants, as required by institutional ethics guidelines.\n\nEthical Issue: Violation of informed consent and failure to protect research participants.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics emphasizes the need for informed consent in all research involving human subjects. The researcher should stop the experiment and ensure that all participants are properly informed and consent to the study. The research must be reviewed by the institution’s ethics committee, and the researcher should undergo additional training on ethical research practices involving human participants.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.11 10. Scenario: Supervisor Taking Credit for Student’s Research\nA PhD student completes the majority of the work for their dissertation, but the supervisor insists on being listed as the first author on the resulting publication without contributing significantly.\n\nEthical Issue: Unjustified authorship and failure to recognize the primary contributor.\n\n\nSolution: The APS Code of Ethics states that authorship should be based on actual contributions. The supervisor’s insistence on being the first author without significant input violates ethical guidelines. The student should discuss the situation with the supervisor and institution to ensure proper recognition of their contributions. Clear authorship guidelines should be established to avoid similar conflicts in the future.",
