## Unit 2: Literature Survey
- Focuses on the importance of literature surveys, planning literature searches, identifying key concepts, and evaluating source reliability.
- Equips scholars with strategies for locating relevant literature to contextualize their research.

## Unit 3: Problem Formulation and Data Analysis
- Covers experimental research, hypothesis development, causality, error analysis, and statistical design of experiments.
- Includes hands-on training with R software for statistical analysis, sampling, surveys, and interpretation of results.

## Unit 4: Philosophy and Ethics in Research
- Introduces philosophy and ethics, focusing on moral philosophy, intellectual honesty, research integrity, and scientific misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, falsification).
- Discusses publication ethics, conflicts of interest, and best practices for ensuring ethical conduct in research.

By the end of the course, scholars will be equipped with both the practical skills and ethical principles necessary for conducting impactful, responsible research.
