Understanding these categories helps researchers select an appropriate methodology. A mind map of approved types of research is given below.\n\n\nBasic (Fundamental) Research: Aims to expand general knowledge without immediate practical application. Often theoretical, basic research seeks to increase understanding of fundamental principles.\nExample: A theoretical physics study on string theory aims to enhance understanding of the universe’s structure without immediate practical application.\nApplied Research: Seeks to solve practical, real-world problems by applying existing knowledge.\nCase Study: A research project aiming to optimize renewable energy sources (e.g., solar or wind) for urban settings, providing solutions to real-world energy challenges.\nDescriptive Research: Focuses on describing phenomena as they exist without manipulating variables. Common in fields like psychology, sociology, and market research.\nExample: A study analyzing consumer preferences in online shopping behavior, collecting data on demographics, shopping frequency, and preferences without altering the environment.\nAnalytical Research: Uses existing data to explore new relationships and insights, typically involving statistical analysis.\nCase Study: An analysis of existing health data to identify patterns in the spread of a disease, like examining historical data from past flu outbreaks to predict future trends.\nExploratory Research: Conducted to gain insight into an area with limited existing knowledge. Often serves as a preliminary step to more structured research.\nExample: Interviews with social media influencers to explore how they perceive their role in modern advertising could serve as the basis for more in-depth studies on social influence.\nConfirmatory Research: Conducted to confirm hypotheses or theories by testing specific predictions, often using statistical tests to validate results.\nCase Study: A psychology study tests whether a new therapeutic approach reduces anxiety levels in a specific demographic, using structured methods to confirm initial hypotheses.\nQuantitative Research: Involves the collection and analysis of numerical data to find patterns, test hypotheses, or make predictions. It often uses structured tools like surveys or experiments.\nQualitative Research: Focuses on exploring ideas, understanding experiences, and interpreting non-numerical data, typically collected through interviews, observations, and open-ended surveys.",

The purpose is to develop a body of literature that establishes a contrarian viewpoint. Given the value-laden nature of some social science research [e.g., educational reform; immigration control], argumentative approaches to analyzing the literature can be a legitimate and important form of discourse. However, note that they can also introduce problems of bias when they are used to make summary claims of the sort found in systematic reviews.\nIntegrative Review: Considered a form of research that reviews, critiques, and synthesizes representative literature on a topic in an integrated way such that new frameworks and perspectives on the topic are generated. The body of literature includes all studies that address related or identical hypotheses. A well-done integrative review meets the same standards as primary research in regard to clarity, rigor, and replication.\nHistorical Review: Few things rest in isolation from historical precedent. Historical reviews are focused on examining research throughout a period of time, often starting with the first time an issue, concept, theory, phenomenon emerged in the literature, then tracing its evolution within the scholarship of a discipline. The purpose is to place research in a historical context to show familiarity with state-of-the-art developments and to identify the likely directions for future research.\nMethodological Review: A review does not always focus on what someone said [content], but how they said it [method of analysis]. This approach provides a framework of understanding at different levels (i.e. those of theory, substantive fields, research approaches, and data collection and analysis techniques), enables researchers to draw on a wide variety of knowledge ranging from the conceptual level to practical documents for use in fieldwork in the areas of ontological and epistemological consideration, quantitative and qualitative integration, sampling, interviewing, data collection and data analysis, and helps highlight many ethical issues which we should be aware of and consider as we go through our study.\nSystematic Review: This form consists of an overview of existing evidence pertinent to a clearly formulated research question, which uses pre-specified and standardized methods to identify and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect, report, and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. Typically it focuses on a very specific empirical question, often posed in a cause-and-effect form, such as “To what extent does A contribute to B?”\nTheoretical Review: The purpose of this form is to concretely examine the corpus of theory that has accumulated in regard to an issue, concept, theory, phenomenon. The theoretical literature review help establish what theories already exist, the relationships between them, to what degree the existing theories have been investigated, and to develop new hypotheses to be tested. Often this form is used to help establish a lack of appropriate theories or reveal that current theories are inadequate for explaining new or emerging research problems. The unit of analysis can focus on a theoretical concept or a whole theory or framework.",

    "section": "2.6 Identifying Key Concepts and Keywords for Literature Review",
    "text": "2.6 Identifying Key Concepts and Keywords for Literature Review\nOne of the first tasks when conducting a literature review is to clearly identify the research topic or question. This step involves a comprehensive understanding of the topic, breaking it down into smaller components, and identifying key concepts that will form the foundation of the literature search.\nTo begin with, the researcher needs to understand the broader research field and the specific problem they intend to solve. For example, a study focused on improving solar panel efficiency using advanced materials requires an understanding of both solar technology and material science. These broad topics provide the groundwork for narrowing down the scope and identifying the key concepts such as solar efficiency, material properties, and energy conversion. A well-defined topic enables the researcher to break down the research question into its component parts, identifying the main ideas that will guide the literature search.\nOnce the research question has been clarified, it should be broken down into its fundamental components. Typically, these components are the essential nouns or noun phrases that represent the focus of the research. This step ensures that every relevant aspect of the question is examined. For instance, in a study asking, “What is the effect of renewable energy integration on grid stability?”, the main components would be renewable energy (the broad area), power grid (the context), and grid stability (the outcome). By dissecting the research question, the researcher can form a more targeted approach to their literature search, ensuring that no critical areas are overlooked.\nThe next step involves identifying the key concepts, which are the cornerstone ideas directly related to the research problem. These key concepts are central to the research and should reflect the primary focus areas. For example, in a study on predictive maintenance using machine learning in industrial robots, the key concepts might be predictive maintenance, machine learning, and industrial robots. These concepts guide the researcher in identifying the most relevant literature, theories, and models that apply to their area of study.\nSynonyms and alternative phrases for each key concept must also be considered to capture a broader range of literature. Different researchers may use varied terminology for similar concepts, so it’s essential to consider all possible variations. Taking renewable energy as an example, synonyms such as green energy, clean energy, sustainable energy, and alternative energy sources should be used to ensure a comprehensive search. Similarly, the term machine learning might also be represented by terms like artificial intelligence, predictive algorithms, or neural networks. Using a variety of synonyms and alternative phrases in the literature search increases the likelihood of retrieving relevant studies that might otherwise be missed.\nBoolean operators play a crucial role in refining the literature search. These operators — AND, OR, and NOT — are used to combine or exclude specific keywords in a search, helping to narrow down or broaden the results. For instance, using AND in the query “renewable energy AND grid stability” will retrieve studies that discuss both renewable energy and grid stability together, while using OR in “renewable energy OR alternative energy sources” will provide results for either term. Excluding unrelated topics can also be done using NOT, as in “renewable energy NOT fossil fuels,” which will eliminate studies focused on fossil fuels. Effectively utilizing Boolean operators allows researchers to fine-tune their search and yield more focused and relevant results.\nIn addition to Boolean operators, truncation and wildcards are powerful tools in literature searching. Truncation involves using a symbol, usually an asterisk (), to search for multiple word forms. For example, searching for “optim” will return results for optimize, optimization, and optimizing. Wildcards, on the other hand, allow the researcher to search for words with various spellings, such as “colo*r” to capture both color and colour. This technique ensures that different word forms and spellings do not lead to missed relevant studies.\nBuilding a keyword list is another essential step in organizing a literature search. After identifying key concepts and their synonyms, the researcher should create a list of keywords. This list must cover the primary terms and their variations to ensure that the search is thorough and inclusive. For instance, for a study on data privacy in cloud computing systems, the keyword list might include terms like data privacy, cloud security, encryption, cloud storage, confidential computing, and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Having a well-structured keyword list allows the researcher to run an organized and efficient literature search across databases.\nIt’s also crucial to search in specialized databases relevant to the field of study. Different disciplines have dedicated databases that house specialized research. For example, engineering research may require the use of IEEE Xplore, while medical research might rely on PubMed or Medline. These databases focus on high-quality, field-specific studies and can provide more accurate and reliable information for the literature review. For example, a mechanical engineering researcher might use IEEE Xplore to search for studies related to robotics or automation, while a medical researcher investigating clinical trials may turn to PubMed or the Cochrane Library. Choosing the appropriate database is key to finding relevant and valuable studies.\nAfter conducting the initial search, the results need to be carefully reviewed to determine their relevance to the research question. Titles, abstracts, and keywords should be examined to assess whether the articles align with the research objectives. If the results are not as relevant as expected, the researcher may need to refine their search strategy by adjusting keywords, adding Boolean operators, or excluding certain topics. For instance, if a search for machine learning AND predictive maintenance returns too many general results on machine learning, refining the search with a more specific term, such as in industrial robots, can help narrow the focus. This process of reviewing and refining the search ensures that the literature review is focused and that the most relevant studies are included.",

It involves defining the research objective, understanding system behavior, and identifying variables and constraints. Well-formulated problems lead to efficient experiment designs and meaningful conclusions.\nSteps in Problem Formulation:\n\nObjective Definition: Clearly state the purpose of the experiment or study.\nVariable Identification: Determine the dependent (response) and independent (input) variables.\nConstraints: List the practical and theoretical limitations (e.g., resources, physical conditions).\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Objective Definition\nTo begin with, the researcher needs to clearly define the objective of their study. A well-defined objective guides the entire research process and ensures that the study addresses specific questions effectively. For instance, consider a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a new medication. The objective could be to determine whether this new medication significantly improves patient outcomes compared to a placebo. By setting a clear objective, researchers establish a focus that will help in setting precise goals, formulating hypotheses, and designing the experiment.\n\n\n\nMindmap on problem formulation.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Variable Identification\nIdentifying variables is crucial for designing an effective experiment. Variables are classified into independent, dependent, and control categories. The independent variables are those that are manipulated by the researcher, while dependent variables are the outcomes measured in response to these manipulations. Control variables are kept constant to ensure that they do not affect the results.\nFor example, in a clinical trial investigating a new drug, the independent variable could be the dosage of the drug administered, the dependent variable could be the reduction in symptoms, and control variables might include factors like the age and gender of participants. By carefully identifying and controlling these variables, researchers can isolate the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables.\n\n\n\nVariable Identification Steps\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Constraints\nConstraints are limitations that affect the research design and implementation. These could be related to budget, time, or resources. Identifying constraints helps researchers plan a feasible study and manage expectations realistically.\nFor instance, if a research project is constrained by a limited budget, it may be necessary to reduce the number of participants or simplify the experimental design. Similarly, time constraints might affect the duration of the study or the complexity of the data collection process. Understanding these constraints is essential for developing a practical research plan that can achieve meaningful results within the available resources.\n\n\n\nConstrains in Research\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Modelling & Simulation\n\n3.1.5.1 Mathematical Models\nMathematical models use mathematical equations to represent relationships between variables and predict outcomes. These models help in understanding complex systems and making quantitative predictions.\nFor example, a linear regression model might be used to study the effect of different drug dosages on blood pressure. In this case, the model would use an equation to describe the relationship between dosage (independent variable) and blood pressure (dependent variable). The results can provide insights into how varying dosages might affect blood pressure, helping researchers optimize treatment protocols.\n\n\n\nMathematical and Statistical Models\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.2 Simulation Models\nSimulation models replicate real-world processes to predict outcomes under various scenarios. They allow researchers to test different conditions and understand how variables interact in a controlled environment.\nFor example, a Monte Carlo simulation might be used to assess the risk of different investment strategies. By running simulations with random variables representing market conditions, researchers can estimate the potential risks and returns of various investment options, helping investors make informed decisions based on simulated outcomes.\n\n\n\nSimulation Models",

It serves as the default assumption that researchers aim to test against.\nFor instance, in a clinical trial comparing two drugs, the null hypothesis might state, “There is no difference in blood pressure reduction between Drug A and Drug B.” Researchers then use statistical tests to determine if the observed data provides sufficient evidence to reject this null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\nThe alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposes that there is an effect or difference between groups. It reflects the researcher’s prediction or expectation.\nFor example, if researchers believe that Drug A will significantly reduce blood pressure more than Drug B, the alternative hypothesis might be, “Patients receiving Drug A will experience a greater reduction in blood pressure compared to those receiving Drug B.” This hypothesis is tested against the null hypothesis to evaluate the evidence for the predicted effect.",
